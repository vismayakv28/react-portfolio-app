                         Hi, I’m Vismay, an aspiring Java Full Stack Developer currently building my expertise in full-stack development. I’ve already completed the front-end development track, gaining strong skills in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and responsive UI design. As I continue progressing through the full-stack journey, I’m expanding my knowledge of Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, MySQL, and backend architecture.
                        <br />
                        I’m passionate about creating clean, intuitive, and user-friendly web applications that balance both functionality and design. I enjoy turning ideas into real projects and constantly learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices that help me grow as a developer.
                        <br />
                        My goal is to become a well-rounded full stack engineer capable of building scalable applications from the ground up — from designing smooth user interfaces to implementing powerful backend systems.
                        <br />
                        When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, working on personal projects, and improving my problem-solving skills.
                    </p>
